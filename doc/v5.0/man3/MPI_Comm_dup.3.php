.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]MPI_Comm_dup\f[R] duplicates the existing communicator
\f[C]comm\f[R] with associated key values.
For each key value, the respective copy callback function determines the
attribute value associated with this key in the new communicator; one
particular action that a copy callback may take is to delete the
attribute from the new communicator.
Returns in newcomm a new communicator with the same group, any copied
cached information, but a new context (see Section 5.7.1 of the MPI-1
Standard, \[lq]Functionality\[rq]).
.SH Notes
.PP
This operation is used to provide a parallel library call with a
duplicate communication space that has the same properties as the
original communicator.
This includes any attributes (see below) and topologies (see Chapter 6,
\[lq]Process Topologies,\[rq] in the MPI-1 Standard).
This call is valid even if there are pending point-to-point
communications involving the communicator \f[C]comm\f[R].
A typical call might involve an \f[C]MPI_Comm_dup\f[R] at the beginning
of the parallel call, and an \f[C]MPI_Comm_free\f[R] of that duplicated
communicator at the end of the call.
Other models of communicator management are also possible.
This call applies to both intra- and intercommunicators.
Note that it is not defined by the MPI standard what happens if the
attribute copy callback invokes other MPI functions.
In Open MPI, it is not valid for attribute copy callbacks (or any of
their children) to add or delete attributes on the same object on which
the attribute copy callback is being invoked.
.SH Errors
.PP
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.
By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O
function errors.
The error handler may be changed with \f[C]MPI_Comm_set_errhandler\f[R];
the predefined error handler \f[C]MPI_ERRORS_RETURN\f[R] may be used to
cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past
an error.
