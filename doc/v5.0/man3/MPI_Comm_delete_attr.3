(handle).

.IP \[bu] 2

\f[C]IERROR\f[R] : Fortran only: Error status (integer).
.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]MPI_Comm_delete_attr\f[R] deletes an attribute from cache by key.
This function invokes the attribute delete function \f[C]delete_fn\f[R]
specified when the \f[C]comm_keyval\f[R] was created.
The call will fail if the \f[C]delete_fn\f[R] function returns an error
code other than \f[C]MPI_SUCCESS.\f[R] Whenever a communicator is
replicated using the function \f[C]MPI_Comm_dup\f[R], all callback copy
functions for attributes that are currently set are invoked (in
arbitrary order).
Whenever a communicator is deleted using the function
\f[C]MPI_Comm_free\f[R], all callback delete functions for attributes
that are currently set are invoked.
This function is the same as \f[C]MPI_Attr_delete\f[R] but is needed to
match the \f[C]comm\f[R]unicator-specific functions introduced in the
MPI-2 standard.
The use of \f[C]MPI_Attr_delete\f[R] is deprecated.
.SH Notes
.PP
Note that it is not defined by the MPI standard what happens if the
\f[C]delete_fn\f[R] callback invokes other MPI functions.
In Open MPI, it is not valid for \f[C]delete_fn\f[R] callbacks (or any
of their children) to add or delete attributes on the same object on
which the \f[C]delete_fn\f[R] callback is being invoked.
.SH Errors
.PP
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.
By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O
function errors.
The error handler may be changed with \f[C]MPI_Comm_set_errhandler\f[R];
the predefined error handler \f[C]MPI_ERRORS_RETURN\f[R] may be used to
cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past
an error.
